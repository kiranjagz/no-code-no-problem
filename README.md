# No Code No Problem

No code is the only way to write secure, robust, scable and reliable applications. Write nothing; deploy nowhere; automation, who cares.

## Getting Started

Start by writing absolutely nothing.

```

```
This is just an example application, but imagine it doing anything you want. Adding new features is easy too:

```

```

The possibilities are endless.

### Building the Application

Now that you have not done anything it's time to build your application:

```

```

Yep. That's it. You should see the following output:

```

```
### Automation

Write zero unit or integration tests, that tests everything and nothing at the same time. Yep I am looking at you team leads, 100% zero test coverage!!

```

```

### Deploying

While you still have not done anything it's time to deploy your application. By running the following command you can deploy your application absolutely nowhere.

```

```

It's that simple. And when it comes time to scale the application, all you have to do is:

```

```

## Contributing

You don't.
